# Highlight Samples mod for Helldivers 2
**Disclaimer:** The mod isn't made by me and I don't know who is the author.  

The mod applies glowing textures to Common and Rare samples, Super Credits and Medals, making them much easier to detect.  
Also it shows a glowing cube or Arrow above Bunkers and destroyable Containers, where loot can be found.
